# WP-CONFIG-HARDENED
### Make your WordPress install more secure

Proposing an edited version of the standard wp-config-sample.php template distributed with every new WordPress install.

The goal is to contribute to a safer, and more secure CMS and minimize users' security concerns right from the start.

The template file comes in two variations:
- one only containing the raw PHP (including the usual WP.org explanations)
- the other annotated to explain my alterations

Helps with both website security and performance. Have a look at the wp-on-NGINX in this repo!
